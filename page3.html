It works. <a href="https://www.unicef.org/parenting/child-development/babies-screen-time">Screens captivate children’s attention in a way almost nothing else does, allowing parents a bit of a breather."</a> "The sudden and unexpected growth of the interweb has spiked some concerns among researchers about the effects of technology on human interaction, behavior and development. <a href="https://wou.edu/westernhowl/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ipad-kid/">As the past decade has shocked and drastically changed the world, the United States has experienced the effects of chronic technological dependency in children that has been dubbed the infamous rise of the 'iPad kid'."</a></p>

  	<div class="rellax" data-rellax-speed="6"><div class="items" style="border: 3px solid #fff;"><p>"New studies of infant and toddler brain development and behavior suggest that frequent screen exposure is linked to diminished capacity for two traits crucial for success in school and for coping with all sorts of life challenges: executive function and self-regulation. The former refers to the capacity to initiate tasks and see them to completion; the latter has to do with self-control, including the capacity to delay gratification and to manage powerful emotions without harming oneself or others. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/29/digital-technologies-social-media-babies-marketing/">Equally concerning, more screen time before 12 months is linked to delays in communication and problem-solving at ages 2 and 4."</a></p></div></div>
